BNP,"
			    I recently was seen in the ER for shortness of breath. The doctor ordered a NT-proBNP blood test. During my visit he said my blood work looked fine. But later I reviewed my lab results print-out and it showed the BNP test was flagged as 'abnormal' with a result of less than 15 pg/ml. The reference range is 0-125 pg/ml. Is less than 15 an abnormal result? Could it indicate some type of heart failure?

To give some background (I have no idea if this has anything to do with my current condition) I have had bad stomach tension in the middle right area of my stomach and pain for the past few years along with nausea. about a year and a half ago, I had my gall bladder taken out due to it not working properly and I thought that my problems were solved. A few months ago, the problem came back with more tension....

Extremely high bp,"
			    I am a 38-year-old female diagnosed with Stage 4 hypertension in 22010.I am a former professional bodybuilder now running my own gym. My pressure without meds runs around 270/210. Last week l noticed that the veins in my forearms became much more distended than usual. I am wondering if an increase in my blood pressure would cause my veins to protrude excessively. I currently take Lexxel, Vasotec, Metoprolol and Lisinopril but my pressure is still high at 152/108.

Previous bypass surgery + today's use of an inversion table,"
			    I am a healthy ~61 year old male. I had a quadruple bypass two years ago, but recovered quickly and do moderate exercise regularly. My BP is in a great range (120/80) or less, resting pulse is fabulous (<60 - often in the high 40s-low 50s). However, I have suffered with chronic lower back pain which keeps me from doing more. I am very interested in using an inversion table to help decompress my spinal disks. Is there any real concern about inverting given my heart surgery history?

Extremely high blood pressure,"
			    My husband recently had surgery. When he came out they were trying to lower his blood pressure. They had already given him 9 different meds intravenously, the 8th one made it go up more. Since then we have been monitoring it at home. It stays between 140/190 over 113/134. He is concerned that since they couldn't get it down at the hospital that they would have to experiment to find what would work and what if one of those made him stroke out. At what level does it make you have a stroke.

			    Over the last few years my physician has tried several different concoctions to reduce my blood pressure and yet it has only increased. Surely, with the numbers of people with HBP, there would have to be a solution ? When I take my BP at home it is nearly always in an acceptable ratio and yet when I go to the Dr.'s office it is always high. This has been the case forever. Further, IMHO the supplements that are advertised to reduce HBP are as useless as anything that was ever devised.

Spells after triple bypass surgery,"
			    My husband had triple bypass surgery 8 months ago. In the last 3 months he has had two episodes of cold sweats, shortness of breath and weakness. The first time he was rolling a barrel up a hill and the second time he was trying to hurry to complete a chore he was doing. He has seen his heart doctor and had his arteries in his neck checked for blockage, they were ok. I didn’t know if these spells are to be expected since it’s only been 8 months or if we need to see his doctor again. Thank you.

Heart rate,"
			    Hi, my name is Sara and I am 19 yrs old. I take metoprolol 25 mg for tachychardia and I recently got over a stomach flu that caused me to violently commit all night. Today I feel dizzy and when I stand my heart rate gets up to 140 bpm. When I am lying down it is at 103bpm. I am worried something is wrong because of my dizziness and shortness of breath. Not really any chest pain or sweating. I also take vyvanse 30mg for add.

It was prescribed to me when I unknowingly became toxic with digoxin (serious vision loss and darkening, dangerous weight loss, chronic diarhhea etc). It seems many are being prescribed doses at different strengths for 2 times per day or every 12 hours.

High Cholesterol?! No Way!,"
			    I just went to the doctor and was told that I have high cholesterol. This news was surprising because I am an athlete, healthy (I thought), and have a normal BMI. I knew that high cholesterol runs in my family, but I thought as long as I was active and kept my weight under control that I could never have it. I have a level of 220 and am scared of what this could lead to. How should I approach this?

Intense chest pain and pressure,"
			    So just a couple hours ago I experienced an episode of chest pain and now I am wondering if I should do something about it. It happened while I was sitting in a chair doing homework. The pain was intense and felt like a huge pressure or something tightening around my chest and squeezing everything on the inside. I also felt some pain in my throat. Nothing really helped and after some minutes the pain lessened and faded away but lingered on. After a short time, multiple similar waves would happen....

Outdated cholesterol information,"
			    It is upsetting that they continue to run outdated cholesterol quizzes. Healthy fats are now the TOP of the pyramid. My cardiologist wrote in his instructions to follow a low carb diet with lots of seed, nuts and olive oil. Cholesterol is made in the body by combining saturated fats and SUGARS, even those from carbs like potatoes. Blaming saturated fats and implying that a low fat diet is still a valid alternative is just wrong. Low carb, low sodium, exercise, and good fats is what good cardiologists....

What is the name of this heart defect?,"
			    My husbands family was telling me about a heart defect that runs in the family. His mom has it and his older brother has it too, but my husbands never been tested for it. They told me it's when one of the veins (ventricle?) goes straight through the heart instead of around and in times of stress or during rigorous exercise it constricts and can cause issues. English is their second language so they don't know the English name. Does this sound familiar to anyone?

Can Metoprolol Succinate 50mg split into half,"
			    Recently I have gone through Ablation procedure where Dr closed the accessory path way. Then they prescribed me 50mg Metoprolol Succinate daily. I used to take it in the morning but then after 1 month side effects started appearing and I started feeling very sleepy and tired in morning. So what I did was I splited 50 mg into half. Half I used to take in the morning and then half in night before sleep. It really helped a lot and all the side effects went away. Is it ok to do in this way?

Brain dead but heart keeps beating after cardiac arrest?,"
			    Last week, my Mom suffered cardiac arrest. She was 53 years old. Paramedics resuscitated her after 45 minutes. The hospital cooled and rewarmed her body to try and eliminate brain damage on the chance that she'd wake up (2/3 doctors I spoke to said survival was minimal). After the cooling, rewarming, and sedation wore off, my Mom never woke up. An EEG picked up seizures but was otherwise unresponsive. She was taken off life support and moved to hospice. She died 3 days later. If my Mom was considerably....

Slightly elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase was found in my blood so they did a cardiac catheterization and found no sign of heart damage or blockage so they ruled out a heart attack. I've also had more EKG's sense then, and they always come back normal. My blood pressure....
