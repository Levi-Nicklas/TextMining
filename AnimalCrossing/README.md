As part of the *Tidy Tuesday R4DS* community, there are weekly datasets released where people can partake in analysis _for fun_! This is a great opportunity to practice skills :computer: and share ideas:bulb:! 

[Here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/readme.md) is the Tidy Tuesday GitHub repo where the data is shared.
