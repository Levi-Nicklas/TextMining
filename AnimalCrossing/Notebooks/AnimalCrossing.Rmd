```{r Setup, message = F}
library(tidyverse)

critic <- readRDS("../Data/critic.RDS")
user_reviews <- readRDS("../Data/user_reviews.RDS")
items <- readRDS("../Data/items.RDS")
villagers <- readRDS("../Data/villagers.RDS")
```

# Check out data

```{r}
head(critic)
```

The `critic` dataset seems to have a ton of text data about the game. Would make for a nice text mining study.

```{r}
head(items)
```

The `items` dataset has a all the items from the game and how many bells :moneybag: they are worth (buy/sell), how it is able to be obtained, and if it is customizable!


```{r}
head(user_reviews)
```

```{r}
head(villagers)
```
